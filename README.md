# TheFameGame
This is a game of guessing the famous title.

There will be five rounds in total, where you will be guessing three movie titles, and two song titles. You will be given the a very short and concise, one-sentence description of each movie to begin with, you can choose to 'buy' more info on each movie but this will cost you points. You will be given the first 100 characters of the song lyrics for each song, you can choose to 'buy' more lyrics or info on this song but this will cost you points. The goal, of course, is to guess as many titles with as little info as possible and therefore end up with the most amount of points.

Have fun!
